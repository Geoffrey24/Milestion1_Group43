## 5. [Feature 5 Name]
### Description  
The Calculate Total Nutrients feature aggregates the nutrient values (calories, carbs, and fat) from a list of food items. Each food item is represented as a dictionary containing its nutrient information. This feature is useful for users who want to quickly assess their total intake of specific nutrients based on the foods they consume.


### Steps
1. Step-by-step instructions for using this feature.
2. Add additional steps as needed.


Steps
Prepare the Food List:

Create a list of food items, where each item is represented as a dictionary containing nutrient information (e.g., {"calories": 100, "carbs": 20, "fat": 5}).
Invoke the Function:

Call the calculate_total_nutrients(food_list) function, passing the prepared list of food items as the argument.
Review the Output:

The function will return a dictionary summarizing the total nutrient values across all food items, structured as {"calories": total_calories, "carbs": total_carbs, "fat": total_fat}.
Handle Missing Nutrients:

If any food item does not contain specific nutrient keys (calories, carbs, or fat), the function will default those values to 0 during the summation.
Test with Different Inputs:

You can test the function with various inputs, including:
Normal cases with all nutrient values present.
Cases where some nutrients are missing.
An empty list to ensure it returns zeroes for all nutrients.
Use the Results:

Utilize the aggregated nutrient totals for dietary tracking, meal planning, or nutritional analysis.
